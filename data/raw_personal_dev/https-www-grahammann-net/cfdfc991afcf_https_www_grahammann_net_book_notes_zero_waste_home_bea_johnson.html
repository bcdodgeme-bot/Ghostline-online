A must-read for anyone interested in the topic.</p><p>Perhaps the best part about the book is how specific and actionable the advice is. You will both understand what the zero-waste lifestyle is about, and have a long, detailed list of how to implement it.</p></div><div class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><h1>Notes</h1><h3><strong>Chapter 1: The 5 Rs and the Benefits of the Zero Waste Lifestyle</strong></h3><p><strong>Step 1: Refuse (What We Do Not Need)</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>Single-use plastics (SUPs):</li><li>Freebies</li><li>Junk mail</li><li>Unsustainable practices like: accepting receipts or business cards that we will never consult, buying excessive packaging and discarding it without urging the manufacturer to change.</li></ol><p><strong>Step 2: Reduce (What We Do Need and Cannot Refuse)</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Here are three practices we have implemented to actively reduce in our home:</li><li>Evaluate past consumption: Assess the true use and need for everything in the home and let go of the unnecessary through the process of paring down:</li><li>Curb current and future consumption in amount and in size</li><li>Decrease activities that support or lead to consumption</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Reuse (What We Consume and Cannot Refuse or Reduce)</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>&quot;Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.&quot; âAncient proverb</li><li>Eliminate wasteful consumption and shop with reusables.</li><li>Alleviate resource depletion by: collaborative consumption (sharing), buying used, buying smart.</li><li>Extend useful life of necessities through: repairing, rethinking, returning, rescuing.</li><li><strong>Basic Reusables Checklist</strong></li><li>Totes</li><li>Widemouthed insulated cups</li><li>Jars</li><li>Bottles</li><li>Cloth bags</li><li>Rags</li><li>Kitchen towels</li><li>Cloth napkins</li><li>Handkerchiefs</li><li>Rechargeable batteries</li></ul><p><strong>Step 4: Recycle (What We Cannot Refuse, Reduce, or Reuse)</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>If the purpose of recycling is to close our waste loops responsibly, then the processes need to be simplified to support this goal. In a Zero Waste world, recycling would be standardized across the globe, or even better, products would be designed for reuse and repair so that recycling would not even be necessary or at least would be greatly reduced.</li><li>When buying new, we should choose products that not only support reuse but also are made of materials that have a high postconsumer content, are compatible with our communityâs recycling program, and are likely to get recycled over and over (e.g., steel, aluminum, glass, or paper) versus downcycled (e.g., plastics).</li><li><strong>Home Recycling Checklist</strong></li><li>Know by heart what your community can or cannot recycle at the curb.</li><li>Consider visiting your local MRF (materials recovery facility) or gain knowledge of plastics recyclability. Donât simply trust the chasing arrow. Some products with it are not recyclable, others without are recyclable.</li><li>Allocate convenient recycling locations in the kitchen (under the counter is best) and home office.</li><li>Find collection sites for hard-to-recycle items (corks, worn-out shoes and clothes) and hazardous materials (batteries, paint, and motor oil). <a href="http://earth911.com/">Earth911.com</a> and its iRecycle app are a great resource.</li><li>Allocate separate containers as per drop-off locations.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 5: Rot (Compost the Rest)</strong><br/></p><h3><strong>Chapter 2: Kitchen and Grocery Shopping</strong></h3><p>Kitchen Setup:</p><p>Simplicity</p><ul role="list"><li>in order to reap the benefits, you need to make your kitchen a clutter-free zone.</li><li>Most kitchens are filled with gadgets that claim to make cooking and entertaining easier: sorbet makers, waffle irons, panini presses. . . . But are these really being used? If so, how often?</li><li>A less aggressive way is to set aside a day (maybe two, depending on the speed of your decision making) to take <em>everything</em> out of your cupboards (including food) and put back only those items that survive the following questions:</li><li>Is it in working condition? Is it expired?</li><li>Do I use it regularly?</li><li>Is it a duplicate?</li><li>Does it put my familyâs health in danger?</li><li>For example, Teflon (nonstick), aluminum, and plastics have proved to be health hazards</li><li>Do I keep it out of guilt?</li><li>Do I keep it because everyone has one? Is it too specialized? Does it truly save time, as promised?</li><li>Could another item achieve the same task?</li><li>Is it worth my precious time cleaning?</li><li>Could I use this space for something else?</li><li>Is it reusable?</li><li>Donât be afraid of letting go: focus on the benefits that you will gain from living with less.</li><li>But for illustrative purposes, I will list the kitchen items (I will cover the pantry later) we have chosen to keep in order to live a comfortable (rather than a wastefully lavish) life:</li><li>Dishes: Twelve dinner plates, twelve small plates, twelve cups, and twelve bowls. We bought quality ware from a local ceramic studio. I have twelve because we can sit ten people at our table and I need a couple of extras for serving.</li><li>Glassware: A shelf full of wineglasses, a shelf full of tumblers (about twenty-four each). These two shelves cover our party needs and eliminate resorting to disposables. We also use these glasses to serve cold soups and appetizers and to hold a variety of things, from loose salt to toothbrushes.</li><li>Flatware: Setting for twelve</li><li>Cooking: Three sizes of pans, three sizes of pots, one stockpot, three lids, a teakettle (all stainless)</li><li>Preparing and serving: Three bowls and one platter</li><li>Baking: Two pie dishes, one large casserole dish, one loaf pan, two baking sheets</li><li>Utensils: Stainless ladle, spoon, spatula, tongs, and whisk, and one wooden spatula</li><li>Cutting: One paring knife, one chef knife, one serrated knife, one pair of scissors, and one cutting board</li><li>Accessories: Stainless colander, sieve, grater, steamer, funnel, one set of measuring spoons, a measuring cup, a scale, a bottle opener, a pepper grinder, two pot holders, two trivets</li><li>Small appliances: An all-in-one blender and a toaster.</li></ul><p>Reusability</p><ul role="list"><li>If your disposables somehow survived this decluttering process, let me tell you right now: you can reclaim the space that they take up, you donât need them. Keep your money where it belongs: in your pocket and out of the landfill! Throwaways can easily be replaced with reusable versions.</li><li>Our family has replaced paper towels with microfiber cloths, and we never run out.</li><li>We have eliminated the need for trash liners with composting. We have swapped plastic sandwich bags for kitchen towels, which I already had on hand.</li><li>Again, everyoneâs needs are different, but for illustrative purposes, here is a list of the disposables that my family has replaced with reusables:</li><li>Paper towels: A pile of rags for wiping the counters and a pile of kitchen towels (made from an old sheet) for wiping hands</li><li>Water bottles: A stainless bottle for each member of our family; two regular (kids), two insulated (Scott and me</li><li>Cling wrap/sandwich and freezer bags: A collection of canning jars. I have about a hundred in different sizes because I use them for canning, storing, freezing, and transporting food, and I store about ten empty ones in a cupboard for leftovers</li><li>Paper napkins: A pile of cloth napkins. I have about thirty, to accommodate our homeâs guest capacity. I chose medium size for versatility (they work for both cocktails and dinners) and patterned to hide the hard-to-clean grease stains. Each family member uses a monogrammed ring to identify and reuse his napkin between washes</li><li>Tea bags: A tea strainer. I chose a medium-size ball strainer based on the opening and capacity of our insulated stainless bottles</li><li>Coffee filters: A coffee press. Reusable coffee filters are also available for those using coffee machines.</li><li>Toothpicks: Turkey lacers. About thirty, based on the maximum amount of guests that we can host at our house. You could also purchase reusable stainless-steel or titanium cocktail picks</li><li>Reusability is not only about eliminating disposables, itâs also about buying durable quality when replacements are needed.</li></ul><p>Collection</p><ul role="list"><li>Appointing receptacles for the segregation of discards is another key element to a Zero Waste kitchen. It might help you, your family, and your visitors to post a list of what each container collects on each receptacle lid.</li><li>Depending on your composting system, the list that you affix on your receptacle might include:</li><li>Bamboo or rosemary skewers</li><li>Cellophane bags (make sure itâs cellophane and not plastic!)</li><li>Coffee filters</li><li>Coffee grounds</li><li>Egg cartons</li><li>Eggshells</li><li>Expired food</li><li>Leftovers</li><li>Loose tea (tea bags, most of which are coated with polypropylene plastic, will not fully decompose)</li><li>Matches</li><li>Meat and fish bones</li><li>Nutshells</li><li>Paper napkins</li><li>Paper plates</li><li>Paper towels</li><li>Shellfish (crustacean)</li><li>Soiled paper and cardboard such as pizza boxes</li><li>Stale bread</li><li>Toothpicks</li><li>Vegetables/fruits</li><li>Wax paper, including butter wrappers</li></ul><p>Recycling</p><ul role="list"><li>We have a small container to collect cork corks, for taking to my grocery store, which upcycles them. We also have another for the sneaky plastic corks and the rare candy wrappers that make their way into our home. When itâs full, I can ship the contents to TerraCycle to be upcycled.</li></ul><p>Landfill</p><ul role="list"><li>Now that you are using your old trash can to collect compostable materials, you can use your old compost receptacle (usually the size of a small bucket) to collect landfill waste. No need for trash liners since the wet items that usually make them necessary are compostable.</li></ul><p>Grocery Shopping:</p><p>Grocery and Errands Lists</p><ul role="list"><li>Through my business, I was surprised to find that three-quarters of the households that I consulted did not have an ongoing list, resulting in frequent grocery runs (sometimes daily) and impulse buys (sometimes buying what they forgot they already had).</li><li>We keep two shopping lists: one for groceries, one for errands. Both lists are conveniently located adjacent to our pantry and are made of strips of used paper (typically homework printed on a single side). Iâve clipped them together and attached a pencil. We fill the sheets from bottom up, so we can tear off the bottom and bring it to the store. Cell phones are good paperless alternatives but not as suitable for the participation of the whole family or on-a-whim jotting.</li><li>When we want to get something from another store, we write it on the <em>errands list.</em></li><li>Overall, these lists have been great tools for saving time and money and reducing.</li></ul><p>Bulk vs. Bulk</p><ul role="list"><li>In fact, we have been able to shave a third off our grocery bill by shopping this way. If you stay away from prepared foods, cut down your meat consumption, and are careful in picking affordable choices, just as you would when purchasing packaged goods from a supermarket, youâll see your grocery bill decrease significantly.</li><li>We will be referring to bulk from now on as unpackaged goods of any type, including but not limited to groceries.</li></ul><p>Locating Bulk Stores</p><ul role="list"><li>I have created a bulk locating app, named Bulk, so you, too, can enjoy the benefits of shopping the package-free aisles.</li></ul><p>Putting Together a Zero Waste Shopping Kit</p><ul role="list"><li>To reduce packaging waste as much as possible while shopping in bulk, you will need:</li><li>Totes</li><li>Cloth bags (two sizes)</li><li>Mesh bags (optional)</li><li>Glass jars (two sizes): The same reusable mason jars mentioned above under Reusability work great. I use one-liter (one quart) and five-hundred-milliliter (pint) sizes</li><li>Bottles (optional): Empty glass white vinegar bottles work well as they generally have a large screw top opening, but you can also reuse wine or lemonade (flip-top) bottles</li><li>Washable crayon: A washable crayon to note the item number directly on your bag or jar will eliminate the need for disposable labels commonly used in bulk stores</li><li>Pillowcase: Or a large bread bag made from an old sheet.</li><li>Your grocery list!</li></ul><p>At the Store and at Home</p><ul role="list"><li>Once youâve got your kit, hereâs how to use it:</li><li>Use the cloth bags to stock up on dry bulk, such as flour, sugar, beans, cereal, cookies, spices, etc</li><li>These bags also work well for packing bread rolls from the bakery bins</li><li>At home: Transfer your dry goods into airtight containers. I use French canning jars of varying sizes for this purpose</li><li>Use the mesh bags (or cloth bags) to fill with produce</li><li>Use the small-size jars for âwet&quot; bulk, such as honey, peanut butter, pickles, etc</li><li>Use the pillowcase to transport bread from the bakery</li><li>Use bottles to fill with liquids, such as olive oil, vinegar, maple syrup, etc</li><li>Use the large-size jars for âcounter&quot; items, such as meat, fish, cheese, and deli</li><li>Running all your errands on the same day, once a week, and with a list, will not only save you from impulse shopping, it will allow you to build a relationship with staff members.</li></ul><p>Beyond the Grocery Store</p><ul role="list"><li>Bulk is not limited to health food stores: CSAs (community supported agriculture), farmerâs markets, and specialty vendors can be a great source of package-free products, when their sustainable efforts are consistent.</li><li>Here are further package-free food options to consider beyond the store:</li><li>Buy eggs from the farmerâs market.</li><li>Bring a jar or cloth bag to a specialty store for a refill, such as ice cream or candy.</li><li>Refill clean, empty wine bottles during a winery âbottling event.&quot;</li><li>Refill a beer jug (i.e., growler) at a local brewery.</li><li>Note: this method works only when you are ready to drink one gallon of beer at once; it will start to lose its carbonation overnight</li><li>Consider canning the products that you are used to buying in cans.

I use the following mix for most applications.</li><li><strong>Basic Mix</strong>: Fill a spray bottle with 1 cup water and 1/4 cup white distilled vinegar.</li><li>Note: For added scent, you can infuse the vinegar with citrus peels in a jar for a couple of weeks, prior to diluting it.</li><li>Here are examples of cleaning, laundry, pest, and gardening products that you can eliminate from your home by using vinegar instead:</li><li>Adhesive remover: Remove stickers by soaking them with warm vinegar. For gum, use an ice cube to remove the bulk of it, then warm vinegar to clean off residues.</li><li>Bathroom cleaner: Use the Basic Mix to dissolve soap scum and hard-water stains and simultaneously shine counters, floors, sinks, showers, mirrors, and fixtures. You can also dip a toothbrush in the cleaner to scrub grout joints and soak your showerhead in a bowl of vinegar overnight to remove lime buildup.</li><li>Color set: If a garment has proved to bleed in the wash, let it soak in vinegar before laundering.</li><li>Drain cleaner: Use a drain snake and plunger to clear pipes, then pour 1/4 cup baking soda followed by 1/2 cup white vinegar. Cover until bubbling stops and flush with boiling water.</li><li>Eraser sponge (also known as Magic Eraser): Remove pen, pencil, or crayon marks from walls using a cloth or toothbrush dipped in straight vinegar.</li><li>Flower food: To extend the life of cut flowers, add a tablespoon of both vinegar and sugar to their water. You can also remove the white buildup on your vases by soaking them in undiluted vinegar.</li><li>Glass cleaner: Use a microfiber cloth if you have oneâit does not require any other product but water. As a default, you can spray the Basic Mix onto windows, mirrors, and glass surfaces, then polish with cloth rags.</li><li>Herbicide (also known as weed killer): Simply kill weeds by spraying full-strength vinegar onto them.</li><li>Insect repellent: Spray where you do not want ants to come into your house (windowsills or door thresholds, for example). <a href="http://versatilevinegar.org/">Versatilevinegar.org</a> also recommends adding a teaspoon of white distilled vinegar for each quart bowl of your petâs drinking water to keep it free of fleas and ticks. The ratio of one teaspoon to one quart is for a forty-pound animal.</li><li>Jewelry/metal cleaner: To clean tarnished bronze, brass, and copper, apply a mixture of 1 tablespoon salt and 1/4 cup vinegar, rinse with warm water, and polish with a soft cloth. For silver, soak the piece in 1/4 cup white vinegar and 1 tablespoon baking soda, then rinse and polish with a soft cloth. For gold, simply cover with vinegar for one hour and rinse. Do not use on pearls.</li><li>Kitchen cleaner: Use full-strength vinegar to disinfect cutting boards. Use in lieu of your stainless cleaner or dishwasher rinse aid (simply substitute it in the dishwasher rinsing compartment). Use the Basic Mix to clean the sink, counter, and refrigerator (use a toothbrush to clean moldy joints). To clean the microwave, pour some Basic Mix into a cup and bring to a boil to cut odors and loosen food bits. To clean the oven, generously spray with vinegar, then sprinkle with baking soda and let sit overnight, scrape with a spatula, and wipe clean. To remove lime buildups in the coffeemaker, fill its water reservoir with water and 1/4 cup vinegar, run it through, empty, and rinse. To remove unpleasant odors from the garbage disposal, your hands, or food jars, use straight vinegar. To remove tea or coffee stains from ceramic cups, soak in vinegar for a few hours, then scrub stubborn stains with baking soda.</li><li>Laundry booster: Adding 1/2 cup of undiluted vinegar to your rinse cycle will prevent soap buildup and yellowing, act as a fabric softener and a color booster, and reduce static cling.</li><li>Mildew remover and prevention: Use full-strength vinegar to remove mildew off most surfaces. To prevent mildew on a shower curtain, spray vinegar on the problem areas or add vinegar to your rinse cycle when you wash it.</li><li>Nicotine stain remover: Clean walls stained by nicotine with straight vinegar.</li><li>Odor neutralizer: Instead of covering up an unpleasant smell with toxic fragrances, address the source and air the space out. Then place a bowl of vinegar in the room to absorb persistent odors (e.g., in a newly painted room to remove paint odors, in a car to remove vomit stench, or in a kitchen to remove smoke odors).</li><li>Pet repellent: Spray vinegar where you do not want your dog or cat to chew, scratch, or urinate.</li><li>Quick mop: No need for disposable floor wipes; simply spray a microfiber mop with the Basic Mix and mop.</li><li>Rust remover: To remove rust from small items, soak them in undiluted vinegar for a few hours, scrub with a toothbrush, and rinse thoroughly. Rub steel wool on stubborn residues.</li><li>Stain remover: Pour vinegar on mustard, pen, pencil, or crayon marks, then scrub with a toothbrush to remove the stain and launder as usual.</li><li>Toilet cleaner: Spray vinegar, then scrub. For tough jobs, you canâspray vinegar, sprinkle with baking soda, let sit, and then scrub.</li><li>Upholstery freshener: Lightly spray the Basic Mix on a cloth and wipe upholstery to neutralize odors, remove surface dirt, and boost color (first test in an inconspicuous area). The vinegar smell will subside, leaving a fresh scent. Wiping with a microfiber helps pick up pet hair.</li><li>Vinyl cleaner: Clean and shine no-wax vinyl linoleum floors with 1 gallon of water supplemented with 1 cup of vinegar.</li><li>Wood renewer: Mix equal parts vinegar and oil, and rub in the direction of the grain to remove water rings and scratches. You can also use the Multipurpose Balm (see recipe) as wood polish!</li><li>XYZ: eXamine Your Zipper.
