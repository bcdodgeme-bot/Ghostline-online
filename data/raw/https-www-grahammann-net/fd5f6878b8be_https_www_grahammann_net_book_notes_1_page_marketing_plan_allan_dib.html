Â It lays out exactly how to go about positioning a company, creating marketing systems to sustain growth, and ultimately build a company that can run by itself. Â </p><p>Itâs not as in-depth as others, but is a great overview. Â Recommended. </p></div><div class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><h1>Notes</h1><h3>Introduction</h3><ul role="list"><li>Itâs very common for small businesses never to grow past the point at which they generate just enough profit for the owner(s) to make a modest living.</li><li>Professionals have plans, and those plans are based on high-leverage activities.</li><li>By far the biggest leverage point in any business is marketing.</li><li>Marketing is the strategy you use for getting your ideal target market to know you, like you and trust you enough to become a customer.</li><li>All the stuff you usually associate with marketing are tactics.</li><li>Strategy is the big-picture planning you do prior to the tactics.</li><li>Strategy without tactics leads to paralysis by analysis.</li><li>Tactics without strategy leads to the âbright shiny object syndrome.â</li><li>Do NOT mimic large businesses.</li><li>Direct response marketing is what you should be doing as a small business.</li><li>Direct response marketing is designed to evoke an immediate response and compel prospects to take some specific action.</li><li>Trackable, measurable, uses compelling copy, includes multi-step, short-term follow-up, incorporates maintenance follow-up of unconverted leads.</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Act I: The âBeforeâ Phase </h3><ul role="list"><li>Youâre dealing with prospects, people who may not even know you exist. In this phase you identify a target market, craft a compelling message and deliver the message through advertising media. Â Goal: get your prospect to know you and respond to your message. Â Once theyâve indicated interest by responding, they become a lead and enter Phase II. </li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 1: Selecting Your Target Market</h3><ul role="list"><li>You must be extremely focused on one niche here. </li><li>Goal of ad is for prospects to sayÂ âhey, thatâs for meâ. </li><li>Dominate one niche, then move to the next. Never do all at once.</li><li>Use PVP index to find ideal target market.</li><li>Be as specific as possible.</li><li>Create an avatar for your target customer.</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 2: Crafting Your Message</h3><ul role="list"><li>One ad, one objective. </li><li>If something in the ad isnât helping you achieve that objective, you should get rid of it (including things like company name/logo) </li><li>Rather than try and sell directly, just get prospects to indicate interest.</li><li>Develop a unique selling proposition (USP): entire goal of USP is to answer question about why someone should buy from you rather than from nearest competitor.</li><li>Avoid things likeÂ âqualityâ and âgreat serviceâ. </li><li>You know youâre marketing your business as a commodity when prospects start the conversation by asking you about price. </li><li>Two questions you must ask yourself:</li><li>Why should they buy?</li><li>Why should they buy from me?</li><li>The uniqueness can come from the way itâs packaged, delivered, supported or even sold. </li><li><strong>When you confuse them, you lose them.</strong></li><li>Create your elevator pitch: </li><li>You know [problem]? Well, what we do is [solution]. In fact, [proof].</li><li><strong>Purchasing is done with emotions and justified with logic after the fact.</strong></li><li>Avoid boring,Â âprofessionalâ sounding copy, and use emotional, strong sales copy with compelling calls to action. </li><li>People love authenticity, personality, and opinion. Even if they donât agree with you, theyâll respect you for being real and open.</li><li>Take advantage of this by adding video toÂ your website featuring you. </li><li>AddressÂ âelephants in the roomâ - things all your customers think about but no one wants to bring up. </li><li>UseÂ âthe enemy in commonâ in your copy. </li><li>Hereâs my take on namingâ if you need to explain the name, to me thatâs an automatic fail. The <strong>title should equal content.</strong> </li><li><strong>Always choose clarity over cleverness.</strong></li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 3: Reaching Prospects with Advertising Media</h3><ul role="list"><li>Hire experts that specialize in whatever media you decide is right for your campaign. </li><li>You must know customer acquisition cost and lifetime value to track marketing success.</li><li>A successful marketing campaign has three elements: market, message and media - you must hit all three for a successful campaign.</li><li>Try and own your own marketing resources: build an email list, a website, a blog, etc.</li><li>Email marketing tips: donât spam, be human, use a commercial system, give them value, and automate. </li><li>Snail mail is a great way toÂ complement email. </li><li>Try and have at least 5 different sources of new leads and customers, and try and make them paid media (reliable and forces your to focus on ROI).</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Act II: TheÂ âDuringâ Phase </h3><ul role="list"><li>In this phase, youâre dealing with leads, people who know you and have indicated interest in what you offer by responding to your marketing message. Â Here youâll capture them into a database, nurture them with regular value-add information and convert them into paying customers. The goal here is to get them to buy for the first time. </li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 4: Capturing Leads</h3><ul role="list"><li>When interested leads respond to your ads, you put them in a database so you can build value for them, position yourself as an authority and create a relationship built on trust. </li><li>Why do some businesses get a constant flow of leads and prospects while others struggle to get any? The answer is the same as the answer to our personal flight dilemmaâ infrastructure. Some businesses have built a marketing infrastructure that constantly brings in new leads, follows them up, nurtures and converts them into raving fan customers.</li><li>To build a system, we need to think it through from start to end. Â We need to understand how it works and what resources weâll need to run it. </li><li>You want all leads and customer interactions to end up in your CRM.</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 5: Nurturing Leads</h3><ul role="list"><li>In marketing, <strong>the money is in the follow-up</strong>. </li><li>Immediately after youâve captured a lead, they should go into your system, where repeated contacts are made over time.</li><li>Contact does not mean obnoxiously trying to pester leads into buying. You build a relationship, giving them value in advance of them buying anything from you, building trust and demonstrating authority in your field of expertise in the process.</li><li>Now that you have a database of high-probability prospects, <strong>your job is to market to them until they buy or die.</strong> </li><li><strong>Instead of being a pest, I advocate becoming a welcome guest.</strong> Send your high-probability prospects a continuous stream of value until theyâre ready to buy. </li><li>A âshock and awe packageâ is one of the best ways to be mind-blowingly amazing. A shock and awe package is essentially a physical box that you mail or deliver to prospects full of unique, benefit-laden assets related to your business and industry.</li><li>One of the commonalities amongst high-growth businesses is that they focus heavily on marketing and make a lot of offers. Some of these offers end up being misses and some end up being hits. </li><li>Could it really be that simple? Making more compelling and more frequent offers? The short answer is, yes.</li><li>Develop a marketing calendar for all your marketing activities, and assign someone responsibility. Â Ideally hire or outsource.</li><li>In addition to scheduled activities, think about event-triggered activities.</li><li>A rule of thumb I like to use is <strong>if someone else can do it 80% as good as you can, then you should delegate it.</strong> </li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 6: Sales Conversion</h3><ul role="list"><li>By the time you get prospects to the point of sales conversion, they should already be pre-framed, pre-motivated and pre-interested and essentially asking to buy from you. If you have to convince them or put on the hard sell, then you likely need to improve your lead nurturing process.</li><li>Once youâve reached a level of competence, <strong>the real profit comes from the way you market yourself.</strong> </li><li>Resolve to stop positioning yourself as a commodity and competing solely on price. The result to your bottom line will be phenomenal. </li><li>Instead, you need to move towards the model of âeducate, educate, educate.â With education, you build trust.</li><li>You must stop selling and start educating, consulting and advising prospects about the benefits your products and services deliver compared to each and every competitor in your category. </li><li><strong>This would be a good time to share with you my definition of an entrepreneur: âsomeone who solves peopleâs problems at a profit.â</strong></li><li>Bottom line, donât let them think you are in sales for one second. </li><li>Consultative, advisory selling is the most cost-effective, the most enduring, the most impactful and the most powerful marketing strategy a business owner could ever devise. </li><li>Pricing strategies:</li><li>OfferÂ just a âstandardâ and âpremiumâ option (priced about +50% but offering 2x+ value). </li><li>Offer unlimited variation of your product/service. </li><li>Add ultra-high-ticket item.</li><li>Resist urge to discount.</li><li>Invite them to try before buying.</li><li>Make payment easy, and if possible offer payment plans.</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Act III: TheÂ âAfterâ Phase </h3><ul role="list"><li>Youâre now dealing with customers. Turn your customers into raving fans by delivering a world-class experience. Then find ways of doing more business with them and increasing lifetime value. Â Create an environment where referrals continually come your way. </li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 7: Delivering a World-Class Experience</h3><ul role="list"><li>One of the things that separates extraordinary businesses from ordinary ones is that they lead tribes, tribes of raving fansâ not just customers.</li><li>Here are a few of the qualities of these extraordinary businesses that become tribe leaders:</li><li>They continually focus on wowing their customers, which turns them into raving fans</li><li>They create and foster lifetime relationships</li><li>They make it easy and fun to deal with them</li><li>They create a sense of theater around their products and services</li><li>They have systems so that they can reliably and consistently deliver a great experience</li><li>Do anything other than stay a boring commodity - be innovative in every aspect of your business.</li><li>Become a major voice of value to your customers.</li><li><strong>One of the major distinctions between successful entrepreneurs and âwantrepreneursâ is that successful entrepreneurs are predominantly content creators whereas wantrepreneurs are predominantly content consumers.</strong> Even more than just content creators, successful entrepreneurs are often prolific content creators. </li><li><strong>Tell</strong> <strong>your audience about all the effort that goes into delivering your product or service.</strong> </li><li>The fact is, <strong>no one cares about your logo, company name or some dubious claim about being the leader in your industry.</strong> </li><li>They want to know about what your product will do for them, and your backstory is essential to this. </li></ul><p>Products Make You Money, Systems Make You aÂ Fortune </p><ul role="list"><li>The most valuable business systems are those which are replicable. If your business relies on a genius or superstar talent at the center of it, then it will be difficult or impossible to replicate. </li><li><strong>Systems allow mere mortals to run an extraordinary business.</strong></li><li>There are four main types of business systems you need to create, regardless of what type of business youâre in. Youâre almost guaranteed to make a fortune, if you can create scalable and replicable systems in these four areas of your business: </li><li><strong>Marketing system</strong>: generate a consistent flow of leads into the business </li><li><strong>Sales system</strong>: lead nurturing, follow-up and conversion </li><li><strong>Fulfillment system</strong>: the actual thing you do in exchange for the customerâs money </li><li><strong>Administration system</strong>: accounts, reception, human resources and so on; support of all the other business functions </li><li>If you went overseas for six months, when you came back would your business be in better or worse shape than when you left it? Would you even have a business to come back to?</li><li>One of the best tools you can use in building business systems is checklists.</li><li>To recap, itâs essentially a three-step process:</li><li>Identify all the roles in your business</li><li>Define what tasks each role performs</li><li>Create checklists for properly completing these tasks</li><li>Now scaling becomes super easy - just add people.</li><li>Think carefully about how you want to exit - youâll rarely make as much money running a business as you will selling one. </li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 8: Increasing Customer Lifetime Value</h3><ul role="list"><li>The real profit comes from figuring out how to sell more to existing customers. Â Five ways to do this: </li><li>Raise prices (make sure to explain why, explain benefits, or grandfather)</li><li>Upsell (if they buy primary expensive product, add on smaller items)</li><li>Ascension (move customers to higher tier products)</li><li>Frequency (increasing frequency at which they buy)</li><li>Some numbers you need to track:</li><li><strong>Leads:</strong> calculate the number of new leads that come into your business </li><li><strong>Conversion rate:</strong> calculate the percentage of leads you converted into paying customers. </li><li><strong>Average transaction value</strong>: know the average dollar amount that customers spend with you. </li><li><strong>Break-even point</strong>: identify the dollar amount you need to make to keep your doors open. </li><li>Key metrics to track in subscription business:</li><li>Monthly recurring revenue</li><li>Churn rate</li><li>Customer lifetime value</li><li>Focus on your âTribeâ customers:Â  </li><li><strong>The Tribe</strong>: this set of customers are raving fans, supporters and cheerleaders who promote your business and are actively conspiring for your success. </li><li>Fire the rest.</li><li>Another way to categorize customers is using Net Promoter Score (NPS) - positive scores are good, &gt;+50 is excellent </li><li>The Net Promoter Score is calculated based on responses to a single question, âHow likely is it that you would recommend our company/ product/ service to a friend or colleague?â</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Chapter 9: Orchestrating and Stimulating Referrals</h3><ul role="list"><li>This brings us to <strong>one of the best strategies for getting what you want in business and indeed in lifeâ just ask.</strong> </li><li>Ask for referrals from customers for whom youâve delivered a good result, and/or make it known during the sales or on boarding process you expect them to give you referrals. </li><li>Be specific in your requests for referrals (who you ask and what kind of referral you want to receive).</li><li>Try and find other complementary businesses that your customer deals with before they deal with you and form partnerships or lead exchanges.</li><li>Giving a gift card or voucher is a great way to do this.</li></ul><p>Building Your Brand</p><ul role="list"><li>Think of your business as a person. What attributes make up its personality? </li><li>Whatâs its name?</li><li>What does it wear? (i.e., design)</li><li>How does it communicate? (i.e., positioning)</li><li>What are its core values and what does it stand for? (i.e., brand promise)</li><li>Who does it associate with? (i.e., target market) Is it well-known? (i.e., brand awareness)</li><li>When all is said and done, branding is something you do after someone has bought from you rather than something you do to induce them to buy from you.</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><ul role="list"><li>Remember, itâs all about implementation. Iâll reiterateâ <strong>knowing and not doing is the same as not knowing.</strong> </li><li>In my experience, Iâve found that entrepreneurs fail to implement for one of the following three reasons:</li><li><strong>Paralysis by analysis:</strong> they keep trying to learn more or get stuck chasing the latest bright shiny object in the hope that theyâll get everything perfect the first time around.</li><li>Remember 80% out the door is better than 100% in the drawer. Successful entrepreneurs have a bias for action, implement quickly and course correct along the way.</li><li><strong>Inability to delegate</strong>: as mentioned in Chapter 5, business is a team sport.</li><li><strong>âMy business is differentâ</strong>: pretty much any conceivable problem you have or are going to encounter has been solved by someone at some time.</li></ul><p>Time is Not Money</p><ul role="list"><li>As entrepreneurs, we only get paid for bringing value to the marketâ not for time. </li><li>Put simply <strong>entrepreneurs work in the results economy</strong>, whereas <strong>most other people work in the time and effort economy.</strong> </li><li>The more times we create value by getting, retaining and satisfying a customer, the more we get paid. Unfortunately, many business owners get distracted âplaying business.â Playing business is when you do peripheral activities that donât really create much value. Some examples of âplaying businessâ include things like constantly checking email and endless, nonsense meetings that have no real point or agenda. </li><li>Instead of playing business, you must do business. Winning in business requires you to have a relentless focus on the activities that deliver value. </li></ul><p>Your Transition from Business Owner to Marketer</p><ul role="list"><li>Remember, <strong>no one knows how good your products or services are until after the sale. Before they buy, they only know how good your marketing is.</strong> Put simply, <strong>the best marketer wins every time.</strong> </li><li>Marketing is the master skill of business. It will help you make your current business a success and, importantly, it will help make other businesses and enterprises you may be involved with in the future successful. </li></ul></div><div class="form-block w-form"><p class="paragraph-4">Want to get my latest book notes?
