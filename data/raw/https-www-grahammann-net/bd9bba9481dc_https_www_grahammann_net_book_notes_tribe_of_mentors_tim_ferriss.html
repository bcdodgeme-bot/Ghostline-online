Â This is no doubt partially due to the fact that Tim asked each person the same 11 questions, rather than having longer, in-depth conversations.</p><p>The 11 questions asked were:Â </p><ol role="list"><li>What is the book (or books) youâve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?</li><li>What purchase of $ 100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.</li><li>How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have aâfavorite failureâof yours?</li><li>If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it â metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions â what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If helpful, it can be someone elseâs quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live your life by?)</li><li>What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments youâve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)</li><li>What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?</li><li>In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?</li><li>What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the âreal worldâ? What advice should they ignore?</li><li>What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?</li><li>In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?</li><li>When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)</li></ol><p>I liked this book, though I didnât find it as useful as Tools of Titans, and itâs not really comparable to the 4H series of books.</p><p>That said, itâs a good book to pick up and read a few interviews when youâre looking for some motivation or having trouble with a big question, and there are some trends that can be extracted. Â </p><p>The largest takeaways I noticed were, in no particular order:</p><ul role="list"><li>Sugar and carbs in general from grains, etc. are bad - cut out sugar, eat more raw, basic foods.</li><li>Prioritize sleep and fitness (naps are a great idea).</li><li>Be persistent.</li><li>Following your passion is fine, just make sure you are learning, growing, and learning how to learn, and youâll be okay.</li><li>Focus on the micro and the macro will take care of itself - in other words, make the next five minutes great, then the day great, and eventually youâll have a great life.</li><li>To change your mind, change your body: get outside, take a walk, get in the water, do some exercise, find some heat or cold.</li><li>Know yourself, and build your strengths - the Enneagram test is a good tool for identifying your personality traits.</li><li>Make tough decisions by putting yourself in the shoes of your older self, and going through the exercise of looking back on your decision.</li><li>Read and write every day.</li><li>Eliminate distractions as much as possible - this particularly includes social media and your phone, though in general you should aim to say no to opportunities that donât align with your goals. A good test for this is âif this were taking place on a Tuesday, would I want to go?â and reducing the commitments you have to things far in the future, as you wonât be able to predict whether you will want to go until closer.</li></ul><p>Timâs conclusion was also one of my favourite parts of the book:</p><ul role="list"><li>&quot;Based on everything Iâve seen, a simple recipe can work: focus on whatâs in front of you, design great days to create a great life, and try not to make the same mistake twice. Thatâs it. Stop hitting net balls and try something else, perhaps even the opposite. If you really want extra credit, try not to be a dick, and youâll be a Voltron - level superstar.</li><li>The secret to winning any game lies in not trying too hard.</li><li>Feeling as though you are trying too hard indicates that your priorities, technique, focus, or mindfulness is off. Take it as a cue to reset, not to double down. And take comfort in the fact that, whenever in doubt, the answer is probably hidden in plain sight.</li><li>What would this look like if it were easy?</li><li>In a world where nobody really knows anything, you have the incredible freedom to continually reinvent yourself and forge new paths, no matter how strange. Embrace your weird self.</li><li>There is no one right answer... only better questions. &quot;</li></ul><h1>Favourite Quotes</h1><ul role="list"><li>&quot;My obsession with sleep has improved my life immeasurably.&quot; - Samin Nosrat</li><li>&quot;The genuine love for reading itself, when cultivated, is a superpower.â - Naval Ravikant</li><li>&quot;In the vast majority of the professions and vocations, the people who succeed are not any cleverer than you.â - Matt Ridley</li><li>&quot;Thereâs no conundrum that a 20-minute nap canât help me unpack.â - Bozoma Saint John</li><li>&quot;Ego is about whoâs right.

Itâs easy to convince yourself that things need to be hard, that if youâre not redlining, youâre not trying hard enough. This leads us to look for paths of most resistance, often creating unnecessary hardship in the process.</li><li>Life punishes the vague wish and rewards the specific ask.</li><li>First, let us take a quick pass of the 11 questions. Some of them might seem trite or useless at first glance.... But lo ! Things are not always what they appear.</li></ul><ol role="list"><li>What is the book (or books) youâve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?</li><li>What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.</li><li>How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have aâfavorite failureâof yours?</li><li>If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it â metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions â what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If helpful, it can be someone elseâs quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live your life by?)</li><li>What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments youâve ever made?

(If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)</li></ol><ul role="list"><li>To me, proper sequencing is the secret sauce</li><li>Itâs a short reminder that success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations we are willing to have, and by the number of uncomfortable actions we are willing to take.</li></ul><h3>Quotes Iâm Pondering</h3><ul role="list"><li>âAnyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.ââ Oscar Wilde</li><li>âGrudges are for those who insist that they are owed something; forgiveness, however, is for those who are substantial enough to move on.ââ Criss Jami</li><li>âThe first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.ââ Bill Gates</li><li>âPerfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away.ââ Antoine de Saint - ExupÃ©ry</li><li>âThe things you own end up owning you.ââ Chuck Palahniuk</li><li>âIf you set your goals ridiculously high and itâs a failure, you will fail above everyone elseâs success.â â James Cameron</li><li>âLife shrinks or expands in proportion to oneâs courage.ââ AnaÃ¯s Nin</li><li>âAnger is often what pain looks like when it shows itself in public.ââ Krista Tippett</li><li>âIt had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.ââ Leonardo da Vinci</li><li>âAll happiness depends on a leisurely breakfast.ââ John Gunther</li><li>âTo handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart.ââ Eleanor Roosevelt</li></ul><h3>Interviews</h3><p><strong>Samin Nosrat</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Iâve learned to envision the ideal end to any project before I begin it now â</li><li>My obsession with sleep has improved my life immeasurably.</li><li>But the thing that will always get me unstuck is jumping into the ocean.</li><li>Nothing else resets me like the ocean.</li></ul><p><strong>Steven Pressfield</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Who are you really? What do you really want? Get out there and fail and find out.</li><li>Real work and real satisfaction come from the opposite of what the web provides. They come from going deep into something â the book youâre writing, the album, the movie â and staying there for a long, long time.</li></ul><p><strong>Susan Cain</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>You should set up your life so that it is as comfortable and happy as possible â and so that it accommodates your creative work.</li></ul><p><strong>Kyle Maynard</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>The quote Iâd put on that billboard belongs to my friend and former Navy SEAL, Richard Machowicz:âNot Dead, Canât Quit.â</li><li>Itâs my mantra during the toughest moments.</li><li>Thinking of what makes me happy doesnât give me the same clarity as thinking about what gives me bliss.</li><li>For me, itâs the freedom I feel on top of a mountain or the breeze I feel laying on a catamaran net halfway around the world. Bliss is the highest peak of what brings you joy. If happiness is just above the status quo, bliss is what makes you feel most alive.</li></ul><p><strong>Terry Crews</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Book: The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel.</li></ul><p><strong>Debbie Millman</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>If we use busy as an excuse for not doing something what we are really, really saying is that itâs not a priority.

Mastery is the mysterious process by which those challenges become progressively easier and more satisfying through practice. The key to that satisfaction is to reach the nirvana in which love of practice for its own sake (intrinsic) replaces the original goal (extrinsic) as our grail.

All worthwhile progress occurs through brief, thrilling leaps forward followed by long stretches during which you feel youâre going nowhere. Though it seems as if weâre making no progress, we are turning new behaviors into habits. Learning continues at the cellular level... if you follow good practice principles.</li><li>Mastery is a journey, not a destination. True masters never believe they have attained mastery. There is always more to be learned and greater skill to be developed.</li><li>I read an op - ed in The New York Times that described a study of 10,000 West Point cadets who were followed for up to 14 years.

If your highest goal is incremental, patient, continual learning and development in critical skills and core competencies â and you allow recognition, promotions, and financial rewards to be a natural result of the excellence you attain at core competencies â you will be far more likely to experience success and satisfaction, and perhaps even attain eminence, in your field.</li></ul><p><strong>Marc Benioff</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Book: One of the most powerful books in business I ever read was Managing, by the former head of ITT, Harold Geneen.</li></ul><p><strong>Marie Forleo</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Learning and using a relationship communication tool called the Imago Dialogue, created by Dr. Harville Hendrix and Dr. Helen LaKelly Hunt.

Lifeâs greatest opportunities run on their own schedule, not yours.</li><li>My playlist reserved for writing / deep work periods includes:</li><li>&quot;Everydayâ by Carly Comando</li><li>&quot;The Aviatorsâ by Helen Jane Long</li><li>&quot;Divenireâ by Ludovico Einaudi</li><li>&quot;Mad Worldâ by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules</li><li>&quot;Festivalâ by Sigur RÃ³s</li><li>Number one: Every step in your early career must get you incrementally closer to whatever genuinely interests you. The most promising path to success is pursuing genuine interests and setting yourself up for the circumstantial relationships, collaborations, and experiences that will make all the difference in your life. A labor of love always pays off, just not how and when you expect. Set yourself up to succeed by taking new jobs and roles that get you closer to your interests.</li><li>Number two: The greatest lessons you learn in the beginning of a career are about people â how to work with people, be managed by people, manage expectations with people, and lead other people. As such, the team you choose to join, and your boss, are huge factors in the value of a professional experience early in your career. Choose opportunities based on the quality of people you will get to work with.</li><li>The boldest transformations, are led by outsiders.</li><li>Perhaps the playbook to change an industry is to be naive enough at the start to question basic assumptions and then stay alive long enough to employ skills that are unique and advantageous in the space you seek to change. Perhaps naive excitement and pragmatic expertise are equally important traits at different times.</li><li>When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do?</li><li>I whisper to myself, âScott, do your fucking job.â With all the drama around us and inside of us, it is too easy to get distracted or overthink a situation. It is too easy to rationalize why youâre too busy, or why you should wait to do something that just needs to get done. I opt for the no - bullshit approach. When I need to do something mundane, or when I need to do something especially difficult like deliver bad news or fire an employee, I just tell myself to stop screwing around andâdo your fucking job.âI find that self - directive hard to argue with.</li></ul><p><strong>Tim McGraw</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>One of the questions Iâm asked a lot isâWhatâs the single thing that most prevents success?â And to me, the answer is always focus [ or lack of focus ]. I believe focus is the key to everything.</li><li>First, I would do something called the âbar complex.â Itâs 12 barbell exercises done in a sequence. I do five rounds of the 12 exercises, starting with just the bar (45 pounds) and ten reps of each exercise. Each time I finish the circuit, I add five pounds to the bar and do two reps fewer than the round before it, so it looks like this:</li><li>10 reps x barbell (for each of the 12 exercises; same for the below)</li><li>8 reps x barbell + 5 lbs</li><li>6 reps x barbell + 10 lbs</li><li>4 reps x barbell + 15 lbs and (at heaviest)</li><li>2 reps x barbell + 20 lbs</li><li>Then I reverse the whole process and come back down over five rounds, removing five pounds and adding two reps each round, finishing where I started: barbell x ten reps for each of the 12 exercises.</li><li>The second workout I would do is a pool workout that my trainer, Roger, taught me, which is a series of different, repetitive martial arts â based movements done in the water.</li></ul><p><strong>Muneeb Ali</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?</li><li>Asking myself the question, âWhen Iâm old, how much would I be willing to pay to travel back in time and relive the moment that Iâm experiencing right now?â If that moment is something like rocking my six - month - old daughter to sleep while she hugs me, then the answer is anything: Iâd literally pay all the money Iâd have in the bank at, say, age 70 to get a chance to relive that moment. This simple question just puts things in perspective and makes you grateful for the experience youâre having right now versus being lost in thoughts about the past or the future.</li><li>For me, the realization was that I can add more value by going deep on a few things rather than engaging with a broad set of activities. Iâm a startup founder, and there is always something or other to do. Here are some approaches that have helped:</li><li>I started saying no to all external meeting requests as a rule of thumb. External meetings should be initiated by me (doesnât happen that often) and not initiated by others.</li><li>Saying no to all involvements outside of my startup, such as being an advisor to some other startup or project, investing in or trading some cryptocurrency where I have domain expertise, etc. There is only one job / role that I can think about. No exceptions. L</li><li>etting other people on my team deal with external invitations, calls, meetings, events, etc. Build strong connections with your team and stay updated on things through them. In other words, the team members are a filter for all the invitations and distractions. Important stuff has a way of bubbling up and you wonât miss out.</li></ul><p><strong>Steven Pinker</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Find a new topic or area or concern that has a small number of people you respect behind it, but which has not become a culture - wide fad or conventional wisdom. If itâs already common knowledge, itâs probably too late to make a major contribution.</li><li>If youâre the only one excited, you may be deluding yourself.</li><li>Ignore advice to simply follow your intuition or gut without thinking through whether the course of action is likely to be fruitful and rewarding.</li><li>Focus on effectiveness â what your actions will actually accomplish â and not self - actualization or other ways of trying to feel good about yourself.</li><li>Donât think that the arts and verbal professions are the only respectable occupations (a common mindset of grandchildren of workers). The elites sneer at commerce as tawdry, but itâs what gives people what they want and need, and pays for everything else, including the luxury of art.</li><li>Think about what you will add to the world.

Donât waste your time socializing with people who you think can help you. Just get better, and opportunities will naturally present themselves once you deserve them. Only focus on things within your control. And if you donât know what those things are, find someone who can tell you.

What advice should they ignore?</li><li>I would ignore most anything you learn in school and ignore all accepted standards. Free yourself to try anything. The best ideas are revolutionary.</li><li>If youâre searching for wisdom, try to find it from people whoâve done it more than from people who teach it. Ask a lot of questions.</li><li>In addition, focus on something you love, because you have a far greater chance of succeeding by doing something you love, and regardless of whether you succeed or not, your life will be better. So you canât really lose by dedicating yourself to what you love.</li><li>Also, work tirelessly. I feel very lucky and blessed in my life, and I know this is because I totally submerged myself in what I was doing. I spent my every waking hour, every day, enjoying it when I was doing it and truly living it. In a sense, it wasnât a job because it was my whole life. In retrospect, I probably missed a lot of life because of it, but thatâs the give and take. As I think about it, that might be what it takes to start something, but not necessarily to sustain it. So when you start something new, itâs okay to do it in an unsustainable way. Once you achieve it, then you can devote your time to figuring out how to sustain it.

Deliberately, if I have to. If I think itâs not absurd, Iâll continue trying strategies I think might be reasonable, and I will practice the strategies I highly suspect are reasonable, if I really care about bearing out my intention.</li><li>Absurdism is not just a tool for helping people be reasonable. It is also a critique of rationalism. It says that there are contexts where having intentions is absurd. That sometimes rationality is absurd, and should therefore be abandoned. In these contexts, it doesnât make sense to decide what to do or how to spend your time, if by that you mean &quot;pick a goal that you want to achieve.&quot;</li><li>I nap a lot.

Donât fake it. In my view, better to be a cold stiff than fake that you care. If you are genuinely interested in a subset of other people, even if that number is small, you will foster relationships that really matter. As we age, I believe, frivolous relationships in business and our personal life become less and less bearable, so only put energy into completely genuine interactions with other people.</li><li>A second piece of advice would be to seek out mentors constantly and without shame (and mentor others).

I certainly heard it a lot. âYouâve spent X years learning Y, you canât just up and leave and now do Z,â they say.

I do these things for as long as it takes, whether a few hours or even a few days, until my motivation comes back.</li><li>Honor your moods not by forcing a different reality, but by just letting them be.</li><li>Because my belief is that your relationship with fear is the most important relationship in your life, I now spend at least two minutes a day engaged in what I call a fear practice.</li><li>Especially first thing in the morning before I get out of bed, I do a body scan to assess my mood. Iâm particularly interested in how much I feel fear (itâs always there, whether weâre willing to admit it or not), and where in my body itâs located.</li><li>Fear is a sense of discomfort in our bodies. It may show up in obvious ways as fear, stress, or anxiety (which are all pretty much the same thing), or maybe it will feel more like anger or sadness (which can be tied to fear, if fear is in the basement). If it seems like itâs in our minds, thatâs because weâre not dealing with it emotionally but rather intellectually, which is never a good idea. I locate the feeling in my body â sometimes itâs in my jaw or shoulders, sometimes my forehead. Then I have a one - to two - minute, three - step process:</li></ul><ol role="list"><li>I spend about 15 to 30 seconds affirming that itâs natural to feel this discomfort. I may have a big talk coming up or a deadline. You are supposed to be scared when youâre doing big things â okay? Acknowledging this can be life - changing.</li><li>I spend the next 15 to 30 seconds being curious about what my current relationship is with that discomfort. If the anxiety seems out of proportion to the situation, or if it seems irrational in any way, that means Iâve been ignoring fear and thus itâs starting to speak louder or act out. If this is the case, I give it my full attention then, and ask what itâs been trying to say to me that I havenât acknowledged (e.g., âWrite a new speech; the one you have sucks.â Or, âYou forgot to call your motherâ). Being such a great advisor, I use this time with fear to juice its knowledge like you would juice an orange.</li><li>Then, I spend as long as it takes to feel it. Now, this is important: I donât try to get rid of it. That is not what this is about, because that would be disrespectful to fear. The key is to feel the feeling by spending some time with it, like you would with your dog, friend, or lover. I usually do this for about 30 to 60 seconds. After which, fear, feeling acknowledged and heard, often dissipates.</li></ol><p><strong>Yuval Noah Harari</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Book: Aldous Huxleyâs Brave New World.</li><li>So what should you focus on?

The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued.... Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long - run â in the long - run, I say ! â success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.ââ Viktor E.

Itâs a simple reminder that nearly all growth requires discomfort. Sometimes the discomfort is mild, like an uphill bike ride or swallowing your ego to listen more attentively. Other times, itâs far more painful, like lactic - threshold training or the emotional equivalent of having a bone reset. None of these stressors are lethal, and itâs the rare person who pursues them. The benefits or lack thereof depend on how you talk to yourself. Hence, &quot;LOVE THE PAIN.â</li><li>Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say youâre running and you think, &quot;Man, this hurts, I canât take it anymore.â The &quot;hurtâ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.</li><li>If you want to have more, do more, and be more, it all begins with the voice that no one else hears.</li></ul><p><strong>FORKING PATHS UPON FORKING PATHS</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Based on everything Iâve seen, a simple recipe can work: focus on whatâs in front of you, design great days to create a great life, and try not to make the same mistake twice.
