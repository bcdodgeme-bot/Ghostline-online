            A good story can start anywhere, including with anonymous tips, but
            if you want to provide a meaningful tip for journalists, you should
            share specific information — and not general speculation. At
            Bloomberg News, we cover governments and power around the globe, as
            well as business and economics.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have specific information that you’d like to share with
            Bloomberg News, there are several ways you can contact us, each with
            varying levels of privacy, security and ease of use. Please do not
            use any of these methods to send press releases or story pitches.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Email</h2>

        <p>
          You can contact us via regular email at
          <a href="mailto:tips2@bloomberg.net">tips2@bloomberg.net</a>, or by
          emailing individual reporters who you think might have a natural
          interest in your tip.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be aware that messages sent to this email address are not
          encrypted. Email is not a secure communication method. If you consider
          your tip to be especially sensitive, you can follow the methods
          outlined below. Please keep in mind that no method is completely
          foolproof. You should review terms of each tool and use them at your
          own risk. Experts recommend avoiding a computer, phone or network
          owned by your employer.
        </p>

        <h2>Signal</h2>

        <p>
          You can contact us through
          <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noreferrer">Signal</a>, which
          provides encrypted communications through an application you can
          download to your iPhone, Android device or desktop computer. Messages
          or documents sent through Signal are encrypted end-to-end, ensuring
          that no third party can access the content of communications even with
          a court order. The app is free, and the technology is open source,
          which adds additional protections. You can adjust the settings so that
          any messages or documents sent disappear automatically from the
          application after a specified time. Signal is widely viewed as one of
          the most secure means of communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          Signal messages are sent in encrypted form to an account identified
          with a telephone number. You can contact Bloomberg News via Signal
          here: +1-917-623-1908
        </p>

        <h2>Postal Mail</h2>

        <p>
          If you have documents or digital files on a thumb drive, you can send
          them from a public mailbox without including a return address. Address
          it to “TIPS” or to a specific reporter on the outside of the envelope.

        <h2>SecureDrop</h2>
        <p>
          Bloomberg News maintains a SecureDrop server — a secure communication
          platform designed to shield your identity. We set up our server in
          conjunction with the project’s maintainers, the Freedom of the Press
          Foundation to ensure it meets the highest industry standards. We
          control the SecureDrop server, which stores any information you send
          us in an encrypted format and if we are compelled to turn over
          information provided to us via SecureDrop, we won’t have anything that
          would reveal your identity, unless you chose to give us that
          information.
        </p>

        <p>How to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Download and install the Tor browser from TorProject.org. Ideally,
            connect from public Wi-Fi or somewhere that isn’t your home or
            office. Make sure that your computer does not have any malware or
            spyware that could compromise your anonymity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our address on Tor is:
            <span class="bold">bloomberg.securedrop.tor.onion</span>
            or
            <span class="bold"
              >ogdwaroarq4p6rnfn2hl4crvldyruyc2g24435qtxmd3twhevg7dsqid.onion</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the Tor browser has connected, copy and paste that into the
            address bar and follow the instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you are given a codename, you can begin a correspondence with
            our reporters or submit information. With this codename, you can
            come back and log in again to check if our reporters have sent you a
            message or to submit more information.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For added security, you may wish to connect to Tor on a computer
          running the TAILS operating system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be aware that Bloomberg's SecureDrop inbox is not checked
          regularly. It may take a week or more for the relevant Bloomberg
          reporter to receive your tip. If time is of the essence, please
          consider reaching us another way.

        <h2>Privacy information</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            We don’t ask or require you to provide any personally identifying
            information when you submit materials through SecureDrop. However,
            please keep in mind that the actual messages you send and receive
            through SecureDrop may include personally identifying information
            included by you or the journalist.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system does not record your IP address, information about your
            browser, computer, or operating system.
          </li>
          <li>
            The server will only store the date and time of the newest message
            sent from each source. Once you send a new message, the time and
            date of your previous message is automatically deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Journalists decrypt and read each message offline. Journalists will
            delete messages and any materials submitted through SecureDrop from
            the server on a regular basis. The date and time of any message will
            be securely deleted from the server when the message is deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you read a journalist’s message, we recommend you delete it. It
            will then be securely deleted from the file system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also please note that when you submit certain types of files through
            SecureDrop, you may be sending us metadata associated with that
            file.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, if you submit a photo through SecureDrop in JPEG
            format, the file may include information about the date, time, and
            the GPS location of where it was taken, and the type of device used
            to take the photo. Similarly, if you submit a Word file (.doc or
            .docx) through SecureDrop, it may include the identity of the
            document’s author, the author’s operating system, GPS data about the
            author’s location, and the date and time when the document was
            created.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Our policy is to scrub metadata from the files we receive through
          SecureDrop before publication. If you don’t want to send us metadata,
          please use the Metadata Anonymization Toolkit to scrub the file before
          you submit it.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, no one can truly guarantee 100% security of any system. Like
          all software, SecureDrop may contain bugs. Ultimately, you use the
          SecureDrop service at your own risk.
