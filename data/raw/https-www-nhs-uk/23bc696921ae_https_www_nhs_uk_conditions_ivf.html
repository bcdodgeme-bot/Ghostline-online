    <p data-block-key="vtoz5">A full cycle of IVF (in vitro fertilisation) takes around 3 to 6 weeks to complete. It usually follows 6 steps, depending on the type of treatment you’re having.</p><p data-block-key="dv2aq">Your doctor should discuss the options with you and explain each of these steps before any treatment starts.</p><ol><li data-block-key="ejc1k">You use an injection or nasal spray every day for 2 to 3 weeks to stop your ovaries producing eggs naturally. You'll have an ultrasound scan to check if the medicine has worked.</li><li data-block-key="dbnlt">Once your ovaries are no longer producing eggs, you'll inject yourself every day for 2 weeks with medicine that increases your egg supply. You'll have tests or scans to check how well it's working.</li><li data-block-key="dpn2f">A doctor at the clinic collects your eggs using a needle inserted through your vagina. This takes around 20 minutes and you'll be offered medicine that makes you sleepy (a sedative).</li><li data-block-key="9hb83">Your partner is asked to give a sperm sample in a private room, usually while your eggs are being collected. If you're using donor sperm, it will be ready in the laboratory.</li><li data-block-key="6vn6s">The eggs are fertilised with the sperm in a laboratory. The clinic will call you the next day to let you know how many embryos have been made and how many they might be able to use.</li><li data-block-key="2336d">After a few days, an embryo is put in your womb using a thin tube inserted through your vagina. If you have more than 1 embryo, your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of putting in more than 1 embryo.</li></ol><p data-block-key="4kja2">If any suitable embryos are left over, they may be frozen for future IVF attempts. The clinic will discuss this with you and let you know about any additional costs, such as embryo storage.</p><h3 data-block-key="fsdt7"><b>Finding out if you're pregnant</b></h3><p data-block-key="bn5u6">After an embryo is put in your womb, you'll be given a pregnancy test and a date to use it. This will be around 16 days after the embryo transfer.</p><p data-block-key="3ja34">It's important to take your test on the date you're given to get an accurate result.</p><p data-block-key="fjujc">If you have a positive test, you'll be asked to come back to the clinic for a scan when you're around 7 weeks pregnant. This is to check the baby's heartbeat and confirm your pregnancy.</p><p data-block-key="6a48b">If you have a negative test, it's important to give yourself time to recover and make sure you're getting plenty of support.</p>
