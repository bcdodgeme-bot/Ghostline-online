🧠 Strategy Notes
-------------------------

• SEO strategy:
  - Focus on mid-volume, low-difficulty keywords
  - Rank Math optimization across all posts (score targets 70+)
  - Structured blog formatting: SEO title, URL slug, meta description, keyword in intro

• Content Strategy:
  - Personal blog = chaotic honesty, dry humor, creative chaos (Syntax/Nil)
  - AMCF = investment language, growth framing, gratitude/infrastructure themes
  - Meals N Feelz = food justice keywords, donor empathy, CTAs to landing page

• Platform-Specific Tips:
  - Bluesky hashtags: #FoodJustice #EndHunger #MissionFirst #CauseMarketing
  - Avoid “#mutualaid” due to adult content misuse
  - Threads: warm, irreverent tone with visual variation
  - LinkedIn: professional tone, highlight leadership/impact/value

-------------------------
🎙️ Style & Tone Guidance
-------------------------

• Personal Site:
  - Reflective, snarky, a little irreverent but grounded
  - Syntax = chaos, Nil = judgmental calm, both used narratively
  - Posts often involve AI, burnout, creative productivity, web chaos

• Nonprofit Comms (AMCF, Meals N Feelz):
  - Warm, strategic, action-focused — never doom-heavy
  - Muslim-affirming but publicly accessible
  - High empathy, low jargon

• Humor/Visual Style:
  - Debugging robots, cats on keyboards, “3AM plugin panic,” “Ghost King,” etc.
  - Ongoing visual motifs: Post-its, sparks, glowing monitors, chaos to order

-------------------------
🔎 SEO & Rank Math Notes
-------------------------

• Sample Focus Keywords:
  - creative productivity
  - burnout recovery tips
  - automation fails
  - food pantry near me
  - strategic marketing leader

• Best Practice Notes:
  - Use keyword in H1 and intro paragraph
  - Minimum word count: 600 (target 1,000+)
  - Score checklist: keyword in meta, intro, body, alt text, SEO file name

-------------------------
📈 Performance & Testing Notes

  - Meta ads low click-through → CTAs need more emphasis
  - Limited results on Threads & Bluesky → creative still performing better than text-only posts

  - Strong traction on posts with humor + practical SEO (e.g., plugins, burnout)
  - Improved Rank Math scores over time as formatting improved
