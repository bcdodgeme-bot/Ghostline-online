    <p data-block-key="vcrj1">If you or your child have had a seizure you'll need to see a specialist doctor. They'll check what caused it and whether you might have epilepsy.</p><p data-block-key="5sude">They'll ask about what happened before, during and after the seizure. If someone else saw the seizure, it can help to bring them with you to your appointment.</p><p data-block-key="4lvg5">Tests you might have include:</p><ul><li data-block-key="9rpe7">an <a href="/tests-and-treatments/electroencephalogram/">electroencephalogram (EEG)</a> to check electrical activity in your brain</li><li data-block-key="9qv66">an <a href="/tests-and-treatments/electrocardiogram/">electrocardiogram (ECG)</a> to check your heart</li><li data-block-key="c22bb">scans such as an <a href="/tests-and-treatments/mri-scan/">MRI scan</a> or <a href="/tests-and-treatments/ct-scan/">CT scan</a></li><li data-block-key="4cu9c">blood tests</li><li data-block-key="3o6j3">genetic testing</li></ul><p data-block-key="drsp9">Having a seizure does not always mean you have epilepsy, as seizures can have other causes. You'll usually be diagnosed with epilepsy if you've had more than 1 seizure, or if tests show you're at risk of having more seizures.</p>

How it affects you depends on the type of seizures you have, how often they happen and how well your treatment works.</p><p data-block-key="eleht">For most people, medicine works well to prevent or reduce seizures, and epilepsy has a small impact on their daily life. But some people have seizures that are harder to control, and need more support.</p><p data-block-key="8jvc1">Seizures are not usually harmful, although they can cause accidents or injuries. The risk of seizures may affect the type of work or activities you can do, and you may need to take extra safety measures.</p>

This is called status epilepticus, and needs urgent treatment to prevent damage to your brain.</p><p data-block-key="5pi8u">There's also a small risk of dying suddenly, called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). But this is rare, and epilepsy treatment can reduce the risk.</p><h3 data-block-key="1n8bn">Epilepsy and pregnancy</h3><p data-block-key="2726n">You can have a healthy pregnancy if you have epilepsy. But there's a chance you'll have more seizures in pregnancy. You may need extra appointments and tests.</p><p data-block-key="cuej1">You might also need to change your medicine as some epilepsy medicines are not safe to take in pregnancy.</p><p data-block-key="qukf">If your partner takes epilepsy medicine, they may need to change their medicine. This is because some epilepsy medicines can affect sperm, which could harm your baby if you get pregnant.</p><p data-block-key="cc40s">If you're planning to get pregnant or you find out you're pregnant, keep taking your medicine but speak to your specialist team straight away to review your treatment.</p>
